# Image-Recognition-in-Python-from-Scratch-without-Tensorflow-Keras

I have written a complete python notebook file in python on Digits recognition without using any third party library i.e. Tensorflow or Keras API. The whole code is written in the form of functions from scratch to make the user go through deeply into each and every concept.


The code is all explained in one jupyter notebook with a very detailed understanding of how the gradient descent works, the epoch for each iteration and the whole concept.
